# Server_Socks
Python code for server creation.

There isn't much here yet, just some basic code for the implementation of a web server.
It is currently a work in progress. It currently supports IPv4, and partially HTTP1.1 (Get request only)

Download the entire project. It comes with a very minimal webpage that should show if it is working properly. 

The webpage, images, and associated assets should be placed within the WWW folder.

It can be launched by running "Python3 Http_Server.py"

At the prompt enter the IP address and port number that you would like it to listen on.
e.g. "127.0.0.1 8080"

If there are any problems with accessing it via a public ip address be sure to check that a firewall is not blocking connections, or (if you are using a home router) that port forwarding is enabled.
