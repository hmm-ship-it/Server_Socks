# Server_Socks
Python code for server creation.

There isn't much here yet, just some basic code for the implementation of a web server.
It is currently a work in progress.

Download the entire project. The webpage, images, and associated assets should be placed within the WWW folder.

It can be launched by running "Python3 Http_Server.py"

At the prompt enter the IP address and port number that you would like it to listen on.
e.g. "127.0.0.1 8080"
